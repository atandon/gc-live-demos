You want to showcase all the projects you have worked on since
the start of bootcamp, so you decide to build a portfolio website
using Angular.

The Angular app consists of:

    - 3 pages (a.k.a components)
        - Home page
        - About page
        - Projects page
    - 1 main navigation that always is visible and links to 
    each of the pages above

    Bonus: Add a "404 Not Found" page if a user attempts to 
    navigate to a page that does not exist.
