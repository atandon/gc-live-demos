Create a server with middleware that authenticates a request. 
The client (Postman) should send a POST request with an email and password 
in the body. 

The server will receive the request and check if the client (Postman) 
is authorized to make the request. If the client is not authorized, return a 
status code of 401 to Postman. If the client is authorized, return a status 
code of 200.
