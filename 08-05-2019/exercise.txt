Setup

- Create two folder:
    - one for your client (angular app)
    - one for your server

- In your client folder, create a new angular app with one component called Profile

- In your server folder, create one file named server.js. 


Creating your server

In your server.js file, create a node server using the 'http' library. When a GET request is made to 
localhost:8100, return an object that contains keys firstName, lastName, and age.
ie. {
    firstName: "Ricky",
    lastName: "Bobby",
    age: 101
}

Remember to add the 'application/json' Content-Type to your header. Also add the following line of code:
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');

Creating your client

Add the HttpClientModule to your Angular app so you can start making http requests in your angular components.
Make a request in your profile component to your server (remember it's localhost:8100). Print out the entire 
user object in your profile template.
